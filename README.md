STORY

Though the events, factions, locations, and people in this game are entirely fictional, they are inspired by the elements of a real-world conflict that started almost a decade ago and rages on today.
This conflict saw brother turn against brother. Three very different factions participate, each with questionable morality and with no objectives but to take the land for themselves and see the annihilation of the other factions.
Though many of the fighters have lost their lives in this conflict, the vast majority of casualties come from innocent bystanders. Millions of men, women, and children have either been killed or displaced from their homes, with nowhere to go.
In total, over 300,000 people have lost their lives and millions more have been displaced, with these numbers growing higher to this day.
It has become the most brutal human conflict of this generation.
